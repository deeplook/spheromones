This is a notebook with a collection of funny things you can do with/on spheres, mostly using [ipyvolume](https://github.com/maartenbreddels/ipyvolume/). It's still work in progress and will likely be expanded slightly over time.

The notebook can be run inside an interactive, dynamically created [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) environment kindly hosted by [mybinder.org](mybinder.org). You only need to click the "launch binder" button above and wait anywhere between 30 seconds and two minutes. If you prefer you can also have a [JupyterLab UI](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/deeplook/spheromones/master?urlpath=lab)!
